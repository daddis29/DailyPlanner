## Daily Planner

When using a daily planner to create a schedule, the current day will be displayed in the heading.

When scrolling, timeblocks for standard business hours will be included in the daily planner.

The time blocks will be color coded to indicate past, present or future times.

When clicking on a time block, an event can be entered by the user.

Clicking on the save button will allow the event to save. 

Upon refresh, the events will still be visible.
